That's it, every day the QA environment is becoming more competitive, the main difference between a good candidate and some other is only that certification, this subject is becoming more common and will mean the difference in the long run with the next recession just waving at us.

## Let's focus on what's important
On average, a normal person needs about 16 hours of productive study to pass the exam, the real world will never let you do that in a couple of days and that's why ISTQBuster is what we need.

ISTQBuster It's a small project that allows you to practise every day, just pick a random afternoon and read the official documentation with a hot coffee. [here](https://istqb-main-web-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/media/documents/ISTQB-CTFL_Syllabus_2018_v3.1.1.pdf) (Spoiler: be patient).

Then plan two weeks in advance, do 2-3 hours of exams every day and nail it, [plan your ISTQB voucher](https://www.istqb.org/certifications/find-an-exam-provider) with confidence.

## ISTQBuster usage
At the following address you can comfortably browse through the three types of exams that the institution itself offers for practice, I hope it helps someone to achieve their goals, good luck!.
